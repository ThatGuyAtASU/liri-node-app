Liri is your Language Intepretation and Recognition Interface

By using the input concert-this (bandname) you can search a bands upcoming tour dates.

With our movie-this case you can search for movie data off of IMBD. Without an input it will default to the movie Mr. Nobody to give you an example.

The spotify-this-song input allows us to get information regarding the album the song is on, band name and a preview link to the song itself.

Finally the do-what-it-says input will do whatever is in the random.txt file.
